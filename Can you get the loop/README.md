Enunciado:

You are given a node that is the beginning of a linked list. This list contains a dangling piece and a loop. Your objective is to determine the length of the loop.

For example in the following picture the size of the dangling piece is 3 and the loop size is 12:

# Use the `next' method to get the following node.
node.next

Use the Node::getNext() instance method to get the following node.

$node->getNext();

Notes:

    do NOT mutate the nodes!
    in some cases there may be only a loop, with no dangling piece

    Thanks to shadchnev, I broke all of the methods from the Hash class.
