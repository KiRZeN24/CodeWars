    Square Every Digit:

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1. (81-1-1-81)

Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 72 is 49, 62 is 36, and 52 is 25. (49-36-25)

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.

Happy Coding!


    Multiples of 3 or 5:

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.


    Bit Counting:

Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.

Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case

    String ends with?:

Complete the solution so that it returns true if the first argument(string) passed in ends with the 2nd argument (also a string).

Examples:

solution('abc', 'bc') // returns true
solution('abc', 'd') // returns false


    Create Phone Number

Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.
Example

createPhoneNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) // => returns "(123) 456-7890"

The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.

Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!


    Replace With Alphabet Position

Welcome.

In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

"a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.
Example

alphabetPosition("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")

Should return "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" ( as a string )
